# Decentralization 🌐

Welcome to the "Decentralization" repository! This is a place where we explore the principle of distributing power among a network of participants rather than concentrating it in a central entity. Decentralization is a key concept in various domains such as technology, governance, finance, and more.

## Overview ℹ️

Decentralization is an essential principle in creating systems that are resilient, transparent, and empower individuals. By dispersing control and decision-making, decentralization often leads to increased trust, security, and innovation. This repository serves as a hub for discussions, resources, and projects related to decentralization.
